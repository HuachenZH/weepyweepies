## Info
- [edge detection using opencv](https://learnopencv.com/edge-detection-using-opencv/)
- [a library called scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)

## WBS
- ~~a very basic 3d scatter plot~~
- plot portrait in one plane
  - __solution 1: use edge detection__
    - to test before edge detection: gauss blur
    - ~~image sharpening ~~
    - dichotomie
  - try to project on the plane
    - get the matrix of edge
    - extract scatter points
  - __solution 2: more points for darker pixel, less points for lighter pixel__
- plot portrait in second plane
- merge two protraits



to resume: plot the second image then make intersection.  
Maybe use name instead of photo
